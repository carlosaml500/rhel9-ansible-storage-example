# rhel9-ansible-storage-example
using rhel system roles, I allocate either 1.5g or 0.8g lvol on an existing vg, create mount point and mount. skip if vg does not exist of have not enough space.
tried to make as concise as possible, I heavily commented on code to describe my learning journey
hope you enjoy
